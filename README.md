This repo contains multiple data analysis projects including Emergency calls analysis for Louisiana State, Drawing Flowers using Mathematics 

1) #EmergencyCallsAnalysis
I worked on 911 calls for the Louisiana state and analyzed reasons behind call / top 5 complaints etc.

For this capstone project i worked on 911 call data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields:

lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)


2) #DrawingFlowersUsingMathematics
I have created different flowers using complete mathematics including the use of sin, cos functions as well. I have used ggplot to create visuals.

3) #Takeabreakproject
I have designed a project in python that will remind me after every 2 hours to take a break by listening to music.
